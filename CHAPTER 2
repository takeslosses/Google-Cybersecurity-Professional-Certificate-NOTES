hierbij wil ik vermelden dat ik nu bij het gedeelte over CISSP, al heb gehad.


3 different levels of risk, low risk, medium risk en high risk assets


key impacts of threats, risks and vulnerabilities
1. financial
2. identify theft
3. damage to an organization's reputation

there are seven steps in RMF (risk management frameowork): prepare, catergoize, select, implement, asses, authorize, and monitor

controls are used for reduce specific risks
security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks, the three common types of controls are: encryption, authentication and authorization.

The CIA triad is a model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies. As a reminder, the three letters in the CIA triad stand for confidentiality, integrity, and availability. As an entry-level analyst, you'll find yourself constantly referring to these three core principles as you work to protect your organization and the people it serves.
