Once they decide what to focus on, vulnerability assessments typically follow a four-step process. The first step is identification. Here, scanning tools and manual testing are used to find vulnerabilities. During the identification step, the goal is to understand the current state of a security system, like taking a picture of it.
A large number of findings usually appear after identification. The next step of the process is vulnerability analysis. During this step, each of the vulnerabilities that were identified are tested. By being a digital detective, the goal of vulnerability analysis is to find the source of the problem.

The third step of the process is risk assessment. During this step of the process, a score is assigned to each vulnerability. This score is assigned based on two factors: how severe the impact would be if the vulnerability were to be exploited and the likelihood of this happening.

Vulnerabilities uncovered during the first two steps of this process often outnumber the people available to fix them. Risk assessments are a way of prioritizing resources to handle the vulnerabilities that need to be addressed based on their score.

The fourth and final step of vulnerability assessment is remediation. It's during this step that the vulnerabilities that can impact the organization are addressed. Remediation occurs depending on the severity score assigned during the risk assessment step.

This part of the process is normally a joint effort between the security staff and IT teams to come up with the best approach to fixing the vulnerabilities that were uncovered earlier. Examples of remediation steps might include things like enforcing new security procedures, updating operating systems, or implementing system patches.

Vulnerability assessments are great for identifying the flaws of a system. Most organizations use them to search for problems before they happen. But how do we know where to search? When we get together again, we'll explore how companies figure this out.


# Tools of the trade
There are so many combinations that can be used to create a single set of login credentials. The number of characters, letters, and numbers that can be mixed together is truly incredible. When done manually, it could take someone years to try every possible combination.
Instead of dedicating the time to do this, attackers often use software to do the guess work for them. These are some common brute forcing tools:
* Aircrack-ng
* Hashcat 
* John the Ripper
* Ophcrack
* THC Hydra
Sometimes, security professionals use these tools to test and analyze their own systems. They each serve different purposes. For example, you might use Aircrack-ng to test a Wi-Fi network for vulnerabilities to brute force attack.

Prevention measures
Organizations defend against brute force attacks with a combination of technical and managerial controls. Each make cracking defense systems through brute force less likely:
* Hashing and salting
* Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
* CAPTCHA
* Password policies
Technologies, like multi-factor authentication (MFA), reinforce each login attempt by requiring a second or third form of identification. Other important tools are CAPTCHA and effective password policies.



# How phishing has evolved

Phishing continued evolving at the turn of the century as businesses and newer technologies began entering the digital landscape. In the early 2000s, e-commerce and online payment systems started to become popular alternatives to traditional marketplaces. The introduction of online transactions presented new opportunities for attackers to commit crimes.

A number of techniques began to appear around this time period, many of which are still used today. There are five common types of phishing that every security analyst should know:

- Email phishing is a type of attack sent via email in which threat actors send messages pretending to be a trusted person or entity.

- Smishing is a type of phishing that uses Short Message Service (SMS), a technology that powers text messaging. Smishing covers all forms of text messaging services, including Apple’s iMessages, WhatsApp, and other chat mediums on phones.

- Vishing refers to the use of voice calls or voice messages to trick targets into providing personal information over the phone.

- Spear phishing is a subset of email phishing in which specific people are purposefully targeted, such as the accountants of a small business.

- Whaling refers to a category of spear phishing attempts that are aimed at high-ranking executives in an organization.


# Malware is software designed to harm devices or networks. Malware, which is short for malicious software, can be spread in many ways.


# Five of the most common types of malware are a 
virus, 
worm, 
trojan, 
ransomware, 
and spyware.

A virus is malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. Viruses typically hide inside of trusted applications. When the infected program is launched, the virus clones itself and spreads to other files on the device. An important characteristic of viruses is that they have to be activated by the user to start the infection.



Previously, you learned that malware is software designed to harm devices or networks. Since its first appearance on personal computers decades ago, malware has developed into a variety of strains. Being able to identify different types of malware and understand the ways in which they are spread will help you stay alert and be informed as a security professional.

Icons of different types of malware
Virus

A virus is malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. This type of malware must be installed by the target user before it can spread itself and cause damage. One of the many ways that viruses are spread is through phishing campaigns where malicious links are hidden within links or attachments.

Worm

A worm is malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own. Similar to a virus, a worm must be installed by the target user and can also be spread with tactics like malicious email. Given a worm's ability to spread on its own, attackers sometimes target devices, drives, or files that have shared access over a network.

A well known example is the Blaster worm, also known as Lovesan, Lovsan, or MSBlast. In the early 2000s, this worm spread itself on computers running Windows XP and Windows 2000 operating systems. It would force devices into a continuous loop of shutting down and restarting. Although it did not damage the infected devices, it was able to spread itself to hundreds of thousands of users around the world. Many variants of the Blaster worm have been deployed since the original and can infect modern computers.

Note: Worms were very popular attacks in the mid 2000s but are less frequently used in recent years.

Trojan

A trojan, also called a Trojan horse, is malware that looks like a legitimate file or program. This characteristic relates to how trojans are spread. Similar to viruses, attackers deliver this type of malware hidden in file and application downloads. Attackers rely on tricking unsuspecting users into believing they’re downloading a harmless file, when they’re actually infecting their own device with malware that can be used to spy on them, grant access to other devices, and more.

Adware

Advertising-supported software, or adware, is a type of legitimate software that is sometimes used to display digital advertisements in applications. Software developers often use adware as a way to lower their production costs or to make their products free to the public—also known as freeware or shareware. In these instances, developers monetize their product through ad revenue rather than at the expense of their users.

Malicious adware falls into a sub-category of malware known as a potentially unwanted application (PUA). A PUA is a type of unwanted software that is bundled in with legitimate programs which might display ads, cause device slowdown, or install other software. Attackers sometimes hide this type of malware in freeware with insecure design to monetize ads for themselves instead of the developer. This works even when the user has declined to receive ads.

Spyware

Spyware is malware that's used to gather and sell information without consent. It's also considered a PUA. Spyware is commonly hidden in bundleware, additional software that is sometimes packaged with other applications. PUAs like spyware have become a serious challenge in the open-source software development ecosystem. That’s because developers tend to overlook how their software could be misused or abused by others.

Scareware

Another type of PUA is scareware. This type of malware employs tactics to frighten users into infecting their own device. Scareware tricks users by displaying fake warnings that appear to come from legitimate companies. Email and pop-ups are just a couple of ways scareware is spread. Both can be used to deliver phony warnings with false claims about the user's files or data being at risk.

Fileless malware

Fileless malware does not need to be installed by the user because it uses legitimate programs that are already installed to infect a computer. This type of infection resides in memory where the malware never touches the hard drive. This is unlike the other types of malware, which are stored within a file on disk. Instead, these stealthy infections get into the operating system or hide within trusted applications.

Pro tip: Fileless malware is detected by performing memory analysis, which requires experience with operating systems. 

Rootkits

A rootkit is malware that provides remote, administrative access to a computer. Most attackers use rootkits to open a backdoor to systems, allowing them to install other forms of malware or to conduct network security attacks.

This kind of malware is often spread by a combination of two components: a dropper and a loader. A dropper is a type of malware that comes packed with malicious code which is delivered and installed onto a target system. For example, a dropper is often disguised as a legitimate file, such as a document, an image, or an executable to deceive its target into opening, or dropping it, onto their device. If the user opens the dropper program, its malicious code is executed and it hides itself on the target system.

Multi-staged malware attacks, where multiple packets of malicious code are deployed, commonly use a variation called a loader. A loader is a type of malware that downloads strains of malicious code from an external source and installs them onto a target system. Attackers might use loaders for different purposes, such as to set up another type of malware---a botnet.

Botnet

A botnet, short for “robot network,” is a collection of computers infected by malware that are under the control of a single threat actor, known as the “bot-herder.” Viruses, worms, and trojans are often used to spread the initial infection and turn the devices into a bot for the bot-herder. The attacker then uses file sharing, email, or social media application protocols to create new bots and grow the botnet. When a target unknowingly opens the malicious file, the computer, or bot, reports the information back to the bot-herder, who can execute commands on the infected computer.

Ransomware

Ransomware describes a malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access. According to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), ransomware crimes are on the rise and becoming increasingly sophisticated. Ransomware infections can cause significant damage to an organization and its customers. An example is the WannaCry attack that encrypts a victim's computer until a ransom payment of cryptocurrency is paid.
